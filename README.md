# The Odin Project - Javascript Course Exercise 9
## Binary Search Trees
Description: This exercise asks to implemenet a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST), a basic type of data structure consisting of nodes. The tree starts with the so-called “root node”, which then splits into child nodes. Child nodes can split into further nodes. A node with no children is called a “leaf node”.

Note: There are 2 main types of tree traversal algorithms: 

A) breadth-first (level-order traversal)
B) depth-first (pre-, post- or in-order traversal)
